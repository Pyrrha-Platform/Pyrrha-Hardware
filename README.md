# Pyrrha hardware

This repository contains the [Pyrrha](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha) solution hardware setup instructions which runs the [Pyrrha firmware](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha-Firmware).

The hardware has undergone three prototype iterations based on field testing of its functionality in controlled burn environments in Spain.

It is now ready for a redesign to ensure it can be reliably manufactured with better components and wiring to withstand additional rigorous international conditions.

## Recreating the prototype

- For breadboard set up, see [PROTOTYPING.md](PROTOTYPING.md)
- For PCB board, instructions will be in [PCB.md](PCB.md)
- For the case design, see [CASE.md](CASE.md)

## Design review next steps

There are several upgrades that are planned for the next version of the hardware device to ensure it can be reliably manufactured and to ensure it meets international standards for reliability.

The goal that we hope to achieve with the community is a new iteration that takes into consideration cost, compliance, scalability, appropriateness of design, support for automation, and producibility.

Each of these electrical or hardware recommendations are documented as [issue](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha-Hardware/issues) in this repository, or tracked in the [Firmware repo](https://github.com/Pyrrha-Platform/Pyrrha-Firmware).
